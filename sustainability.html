        <h1>Sustainability</h1>
        <p>
          Sustainability in the fashion industry means promoting the well-being
          of people, communities, and the environment. The fashion industry — in
          company with other big energy consumers like agriculture and fuel — is
          in dire need of a thoughtful redesign.

        <h2>Problem with 'sustainable fashion'</h2>
        <p>
          The term "sustainability," therefore, is considered by some industry
          experts to be so broad as to be problematic. Designer Rejina Pyo, who
          works with materials including recycled polyester and organic cotton,
          as well as regularly visiting her factories and suppliers to ensure
          they uphold ethical standards, said, "We don't describe ourselves as a
          sustainable brand because there is always more to do, and I'm not sure
          there is any such thing as a truly sustainable fashion company."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think there is a lot of greenwashing out there, which does dilute
          the meaning of the term, but it is still really important that we are
          talking about it. The more awareness there is the more we can
          challenge and interrogate its use," Pyo added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, designer Phoebe English said the term was important, but
          too vague to be of real value. "I wouldn't describe our label as a
          'sustainable label,' as there isn't actually a defined way to
          determine what is sustainable fashion and what isn't sustainable
          fashion."
