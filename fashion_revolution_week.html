        <h2>About fashion revolution week</h2>
        <p>
          Fashion Revolution week happens every year in the week surrounding the
          24th of April. This date is the anniversary of the 2013 Rana Plaza
          collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rana Plaza, a building in Bangladesh, housed a number of garment
          factories, employing around 5,000 people. The people in this building
          were manufacturing clothing for many of the biggest global fashion
          brands. More than 1,100 people – mostly young women – died in the
          collapse and another 2,500 were injured, making it the fourth largest
          industrial disaster in history.
        </p>
        <p>No one should die for fashion.</p>
