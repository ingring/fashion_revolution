00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Wearing good clothes means the people who made them receive fair pay for their work.
00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
But right now, most textile and garment workers cannot afford to live in decent housing, eat healthy food or go to the doctor.
00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
They even struggle to send their kids to school.
00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
A living wage is not a luxury, it is a fundamental human right.
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
We demand laws that protect the human right to fair pay.
00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
We want to see a living wage for the people who make our clothes around the world.
00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
The EU has the power to change this.
00:27.000 --> 00:30.500
