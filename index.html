            <p>
              Over the past 10 years, we have been campaigning passionately for a
              clean, safe, fair, transparent and accountable fashion industry. We
              believe in a global fashion industry that conserves and restores the
              environment and values people over growth and profit.

          <h2>About Fashion Revolution</h2>
          <p>
            Fashion Revolution is a global movement campaigning for a fashion
            industry that conserves and restores the environment and values people
            over growth and profit. The organisation works in over 90 countries
            worldwide, with both an innovative and international approach to
            research, education and advocacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fashion Revolution was founded in 2014 by Carry Somers and Orsola de
            Castro with the aim to increase transparency in the fashion industry
            and stand in solidarity with the people who make our clothes. Since
            then, it has grown to be the world’s largest fashion activism
            movement, mobilising citizens, brands and policymakers to make
            positive change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key pillars of change which Fashion Revolution pushes for include
            shifting the culture of fashion production and consumption,
            incentivising fashion brands and retailers to improve their practices
            and advocating for policy which holds the industry accountable for its
            impact.

          <h2>Rana Plaza</h2>
          <p>
            24 April is the most important day for fashion. But not because it’s
            Fashion Revolution Day. It’s because over 1000 men and women, with
            families, hopes and dreams just like us, lost their lives while making
            our clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Did you know that 80% of our fashion is made by 18-24 year old young
            women around the world? Sadly the only time we hear about these
            millennial makers is when tragedies such as Rana Plaza occur.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we ask more about them, we can change their lives. Let’s never
            forget Rana Plaza and keep asking our favourite brands
            #whomademyclothes?

                  Fashion supply chains are notoriously opaque, and this can
                  enable exploitative working conditions to thrive while obscuring
                  who has the responsibility and power to redress them.
