        <h1>Who made my clothes</h1>
        <p>
          Fashion supply chains are notoriously opaque, and this can enable
          exploitative working conditions to thrive while obscuring who has the
          responsibility and power to redress them.
        </p>
        <p>
          While a growing number of brands and retailers have published a list
          of the factories where their garments are cut and sewn, the vast
          majority of brands are not yet disclosing the facilities where fabrics
          and yarns are made. When you look further down the supply chain, where
          fabrics are knitted or woven, textiles are treated and laundered,
          yarns are spun and dyed, fibres are sorted and processed and raw
          materials are grown and picked; there remains a widespread lack of
          transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need brands to provide more visibility and take more responsibility
          for their entire global supply chain, including processing facilities
          and textile mills.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re calling upon citizens everywhere to demand greater transparency
          from brands by asking #WhoMadeMyFabric? We’re also calling for
          producers to tell us #IMadeYourFabric, so we can connect more closely
          with the people who produce the fabrics and raw materials we wear.

        <p>
          Have you ever wondered who made my clothes? Or considered what life is
          like for the people stitch our garments, what sort of conditions they
          might be working in, and how much they're paid? In this debut 3-part
          series of the Fashion Revolution Podcast, we will be exploring these
          importance questions. We will hear about the difficult living and
          working conditions of garment workers across the world, and explore
          the ways we can work together to change things for the better. Hosted

        <h2>Where do clothing brands manufacture?</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding where our clothes come from can be a complicated
          question. One t-shirt can have travelled through multiple countries
          before reaching your wardrobe. While a clothing business may have its
          headquarters and design its clothes in one part of the world, this
          doesn’t mean that this is where its garment factories are located.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest manufacturer and exporter of clothing and apparel products
          is China, with 65% of the world’s clothing being made there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second largest country for clothing manufacturing in the world is
          Bangladesh. Garment exports make up close to 85% of the country’s
          overall exports. Bangladesh’s ready-made garments industry has seen
          growth in recent years, with its share of global garment exports
          rising to 6.7%.
