          <h1>Fashion's environmental impacts</h1>
          <p>
            Fashion is responsible for 10 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas
            emissions and 20 percent of global wastewater, and uses more energy
            than the aviation and shipping sectors combined.

          <h2>Impacts on water</h2>
          <p>
            Global fashion also consumes 93 billion metric tons of clean water
            each year, about half of what Americans drink annually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cotton is an especially thirsty crop. For example, one kilogram of
            cotton used to produce a pair of jeans can consume 7,500 to 10,000
            liters of water—the amount a person would drink over 10 years. Cotton
            production also requires pesticides and insecticides, which pollute
            the soil; runoff from fertilized cotton fields carry the excess
            nutrients to water bodies, causing eutrophication and algal blooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dyeing process for fabrics, which uses toxic chemicals, is
            responsible for 17 to 20 percent of global industrial water pollution.
            Seventy-two toxic chemicals have been found in the water used in
            textile dyeing.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Contributions to climate change</h2>
          <p>
            To feed the fashion industry’s need for wood pulp to make fabrics like
            rayon, viscose and other fabrics, 70 million tons of trees are cut
            down each year. That number is expected to double by 2034, speeding
            deforestation in some of the world’s endangered forests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fashion industry produces 1.2 million metric tons of CO2 each
            year, according to a MacArthur Foundation study. In 2018, it resulted
            in more greenhouse gas emissions than the carbon produced by France,
            Germany and the UK all together. Polyester, which is actually plastic
            made from fossil fuels, is used for about 65 percent of all clothing,
            and consumes 70 million barrels of oil each year. In addition, the
            fashion industry uses large amounts of fossil fuel-based plastic for
            packaging and hangers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Waste</h2>
          <p>
            Less than one percent of clothing is recycled to make new clothes. The
            fibers in clothing are polymers, long chains of chemically linked
            molecules. Washing and wearing clothing shorten and weaken these
            polymers, so by the time a garment is discarded, the polymers are too
            short to turn into a strong new fabric. In addition, most of today’s
            textile-to-textile recycling technologies cannot separate out dyes,
            contaminants, or even a combination of fabrics such as polyester and
            cotton.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, 53 million metric tons of discarded clothing are
            incinerated or go to landfills each year. In 2017, Burberry burned $37
            million worth of unsold bags, clothes and perfume. If sent to a
            landfill, clothes made from natural fabrics like cotton and linen may
            degrade in weeks to months, but synthetic fabrics can take up to 200
            years to break down. And as they do, they produce methane, a powerful
            global warming greenhouse gas.

          <h2>Microplastic pollution</h2>
          <p>
            Many people have lived solely in athleisure wear during the pandemic,
            but the problem with this is that the stretch and breathability in
            most athleisure comes from the use of synthetic plastic fibers like
            polyester, nylon, acrylic, spandex and others, which are made of
            plastic.
          </p>
          <p>
            When clothes made from synthetics are washed, microplastics from their
            fibers are shed into the wastewater. Some of it is filtered out at
            wastewater treatment plants along with human waste and the resulting
            sludge is used as fertilizer for agriculture. Microplastics then enter
            the soil and become part of the food chain. The microplastics that
            elude the treatment plant end up in rivers and oceans, and in the
            atmosphere when seawater droplets carry them into the air. It’s
            estimated that 35 percent of the microplastics in the ocean come from
            the fashion industry. While some brands use “recycled polyester” from
            PET bottles, which emits 50 to 25 percent fewer emissions than virgin
            polyester, effective polyester recycling is limited, so after use,
            these garments still usually end up in the landfill where they can
            shed microfibers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Microplastics harm marine life, as well as birds and turtles. They
            have already been found in our food, water and air—one study found
            that Americans eat 74,000 microplastic particles each year. And while
            there is growing concern about this, the risks to human health are
            still not well understood.
