            <h1>Good Clothes, Fair Pay</h1>
            <p>Good Clothes, Fair Pay is a grassroots campaign calling for living wage legislation across the garment, textile and footwear sector. We need one million signatures from EU citizens by July 2023 in order to push for game-changing legislation that requires companies to conduct living wage due diligence in their global supply chains.</p>

                    Wearing good clothes means the people who made them receive fair pay for their work.
                    But right now, most textile and garment workers cannot afford to live in decent housing, eat healthy food or go to the doctor.
                    They even struggle to send their kids to school.
                    A living wage is not a luxury, it is a fundamental human right.
                    We demand laws that protect the human right to fair pay.We want to see a living wage for the people who make our clothes around the world. The EU has the power to change this. Help us get to one million signatures for #GoodClothesFairPay.

            <h2>Why do we need legislation on living wages?</h2>
            <p>Millions of people work in textile, clothing and footwear production around the world. The vast majority are not paid enough to fulfil their basic needs.</p>

            <p>These people remain trapped in poverty while big fashion companies continue to profit from their hard work. It is a deeply unfair and exploitative system, and we must demand better. The Covid-19 pandemic has deepened wage insecurity for the people who make our clothes, leaving workers without any social safety net, and struggling to pay for food, healthcare and shelter.</p>
            <p>This is why the Good Clothes Fair Pay campaign, a European Citizensâ€™ Initiative for living wages in the fashion supply chain, is demanding legislation that helps achieve fair pay for textile and garment workers around the world.</p>
